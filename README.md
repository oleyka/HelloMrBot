Hello Mr. Bot
---

Ok, this is just me experimenting with some Twitter bot data...


Methodology
===

1. Visit @POTUS and grab the handles of a dozen or so users that look like @<FirstName><NNNN>
2. Run them through Botomoter: https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/ to check which ones are more likely to be bots.
3. Collect the lists of their followers and followings, running them through Botomoeter as well.
4. Rinse and repeat until we have a set of a 1000 or so users that are likely to be bots.
5. Match them against the @FiveThirtyEight database to see how good we are ;)
6. <PROFIT> lol... idk. Let's start somewhere first.
